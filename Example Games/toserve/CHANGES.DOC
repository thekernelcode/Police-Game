THE MANUAL

Poor proofreading on my part caused the manual to be stupid at times
and wrong at others.  I would like to make a clarification: there is
no map editor for the registered version.  In the registered version
you can only save a map that you like for future use and change the
amounts of stuff in it.  I sincerely apologize for any trouble this
may have caused.

CHANGES V1.0 to V1.01

Version 1.01 of To Serve And To Protect is purely a maintinence release.
No new features have been added.

CHANGES V1.01 to V1.1

First off, many more bugs have hopefully been fixed.  This includes:

    .  Random Events now work.

    .  The "slumming" effect of cities is now much more pronounced.
       Mapmode two, the one with the gun on it, will now show the slum
       areas of the cities.  Crimes are much more likely to happen in
       a slum than in a normal area.  See the manual for more details.

    .  Vehicle to Vehicle combat is much more likely.

    .  Combat is much, much slower.  This allows you to reinforce as
       necessary.

    .  Time in Step, 30 sec. and 1 minute mode now goes by at 1 hour
       intervals.  The other time modes go by at 10 minute intervals.

    .  If a police car and a civilian car get in combat it will tell you
       in the warnings box.

    .  Saving should now work right.

    .  Rioting thresholds are 10% higher.

    .  Various tweakings:  Fatigue accumlates more slowly when a unit
       is on a training mission.  This is because police officers like
       to be trained.  Also, unit morale is decreased when public
       opinion is at a higher point: before it was 15% and now it is
       at 35%.  Morale still increases at the high threshold of 85%.

       Also, public opinion is harder to maintain.  Public service
       missions have more effect.  Otherwise the passive posture has
       less effect and increases the crime rate.  The agressive posture
       has leffect and decreases the public opinion.

    .  The effect of taxes is now based on the last tax periods tax rate.
       In the beginning, this tax rate is 5%.  Taxes have more of an
       effecdt on opinion.

    .  When it rains, changing the screen no longer causes it to fill
       with rain.

    .  The stupid car-sitting-in-the-intersection with no speed is fixed.
       (Hopefully!).

    .  M-16's have less effect.  Before a cop with an M-16 was invincible.
       Now they are merely superb.

    .  Prisoners dropped off at a courthouse now go to a jail.

    .  You can no longer click the right mouse button on the small map.
       I did this because I never used it and always wondered why step
       never turned off when the cursor was over the small map.  If
       you feel otherwise, drop me a line.

    .  The music option has been taken out of the menu, completing
       what I started in version 1.01.

Some features have also been added:

    .  By clicking on the time and date, you can toggle between two
       time modes: the normal time mode you are used to and the Time
       to go mode which shows how many days are left in the scenario.

    .  Police officers now have their unit ID displayed on the large
       map.  You can turn this off or on by pressing "F4".

    .  Two new special activities have been added: Neighborhood Watch
       and TV Commercials.  Both take about 48 dollars for every
       budget period.  Neighborhood Watch will decrease crime while
       TV Commercials will increase public opinion.

    .  There are now more cars on the screen.  For registered owners,
       the riot option has been replaced with the ability to control
       the amount of civilian cars on the screen.  Low limits the
       number of civilians to 15.  Medium limits the number to 35.
       High limits the number to around 60-70 (depending on the
       number of police vehicles in the scenario).  The shareware
       version is set to low.

    .  You can now select a police station by hitting its ID number
       on the keyboard.  For example, when you hit a 1 the map will
       center around Police Station 1 and it will automatically be
       selected.

    .  You can now select a mapmode by hitting F1 for normal, F2
       for area crime rates and F3 for visual.
