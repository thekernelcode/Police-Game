    Thank you for registering To Serve and To Protect!

    The current registered version as of 5/19/94 is 1.1.  If you
    are not familiar with it, see CHANGES.DOC for details.

    Most of what the registered version includes is in the on-disk
    manual.  However, there are some things that are not:

        .  Saving a map:  To save a map that you like you can hit
           F5-F9 to save a map.  F5 will save it as map #1, F6 as
           map #2, etc.  You can than load this map with the user
           made option in the main menu.

         . The registered version now includes some cheats during
           the game to help you along.  To use them, just type the
           cheat's word during the game.  If you misspell it, wait a
           little for it to clear.
