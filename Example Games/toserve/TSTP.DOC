                                 Vivid Software

INTRODUCTION

The police chief mused over his current predicament.  His city
had been on the edge of riots for weeks which had started when a
failed police assault on innocent building sent the city into
riots.  Currently, all of his available units were being sent back
to base where they could be outfitted with riot gear.  Meanwhile,
helicopters flew over the city keeping watch on the rioters and
the occasional looting.  It was going to be a long winter, and if
the rioters did not stop soon, he was going to have to use the
heavy weapons.  He also knew he would never reach the goal of a
moderate public opinion and crime rate.

This situation could not only happen in real life but also in
this game, To Serve and To Protect.  You will do many of the
tasks of a police dispatcher like deploying units and responding
to crimes.  You will also, during the course of the game, perform
police chief duties like budgeting and personnel.  Finally, you
can also do many things neither does, like deciding to build new
buildings, judging crimes, and taxing citizens.

HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL

There are four areas to this manual.  The first shows how to
to set up a new game.  The second chapter is a tutorial which
will help you get used to concepts of the game. The third chapter
shows how to do various tasks in the game.  The fourth chapter
shows how to play the game and gives various hints and tips.

If you wish to just jump right in and play, you can probably just
skim over chapter three and use it as a reference to the various
icons in the game.  Chapter four will probably have to be read
in depth, however.

Appendix C now describes the six cheats you can use during the game
in the Registered version.

CHAPTER 1
SETTING A UP NEW GAME

Changing and Setting the Sound Setup

After you have performed the initial installation, or if this
is your first time playing To Serve and To Protect, you can change
to sound card setup.

To change the setup, follow this step:

1.   Go to the To Serve and To Protect subdirectory. For
     instance, if you installed To Serve and To Protect in the
      \TSTP subdirectory, you would type CD\TSTP and press
     Enter.  Then, type the following: DEL SOUND.CFG.

If this is your first time playing, follow these steps:

2.   Type TSTP and press Enter.

3.   The Sound Setup screen will appear. Click on the sound card
     that you have and then click on Continue. Your sound card
     setup is now changed.
     
Welcome to To Serve and To Protect!

In the beginning, an introduction will show.  To abort the
introduction, just hit any key.  The Main Menu will appear.

The Main Menu

The main menu consists of four "buttons": Load Game, New Game,
Configuration, and Exit to Dos.

Loading A Game

Loading a game is simple.  Just click on one of the saved games
in the middle of the screen (only games in use will appear).
Then click on done and the game will be loaded.

Starting A New Game

Starting a new game can be very simple or it can be complicated.
In the new game area, there are several areas where options can
be set. These include Scenario, Map, Difficulty, and Variants.
In order to start a game, a scenario and a difficulty level must
be set.  To start the game, click on "Start".  Notice that you
must have a difficulty set and (in the registered version) a 
scenario. To cancel and return to the main menu, click on 
"Cancel".

Scenarios

Scenarios set the victory conditions of the game.  In some
scenarios, the victory conditions include having a certain
level of public opinion.  In others, the victory condition may
be to stop rioting.  Scenarios also set some beginning factors    
in the game like rioting.  Below is a description of each of
the seven scenarios included with To Serve and To Protect.
Each scenario lasts one month long.  Only scenario 1 is in
the shareware version.

Scenario 1, Normalcy:  This scenario is simple.  Maintain a
public opinion of 50% or higher and a crime rate of 50% or
lower. Use whatever methods at your disposal to achieve these
goals.

End Public Opinion: 50% End Crime Rate: 50%

Scenario 2, Shortage:  The city in which you control has
always had problems recruiting people to serve as police
personnel. Therefore, you are limited to a maximum of 20
officers and 40 patrolmen.  Because of these limits, no
officers and patrolmen are assigned at the beginning of the
game and you must assign them yourself.

End Public Opinion: 50% End Crime Rate: 50% (REG. VERSION ONLY)

Scenario 3, Martial Law:  The city has been declared for
various reasons to be in a state of martial law.  As a result,
only an aggressive posture is allowed.  A description of the
aggressive posture and its effects is in the third chapter.

End Public Opinion: 50% End Crime Rate: 50% (REG. VERSION ONLY)

Scenario 4, Riot Recovery: The last police chief who
controlled the city was a bumbling idiot.  By the time the
political leaders finally pressured him out of office, the
city was in the middle of heavy riots.  As the newly appointed
police chief, it is your job to stop the riots and get the city
back under control.  The Riot and Public Opinion variants have no
effect on this scenario.

End Public Opinion: 50% End Crime Rate: 50% (REG. VERSION ONLY)

Scenario 5, New Force:  The city in which you control had
always used a volunteer police force.  But because of the
recent influx of drugs, a large professional police force is
needed.  Therefore, at the start, you will have no police
related buildings and you will have no vehicles.  You are
essentially helpless until you start building.  The map
municipal settings and the vehicle stock variants have no
effect on this scenario.  It is recommended that you increase
the amount of money and personnel that you get in the variants
section.

End Public Opinion: 50% End Crime Rate: 50% (REG. VERSION ONLY)

Scenario 6, Beverly Hills:  As a top socialite in Beverly
Hills, you are appointed police chief because of your
connections.  Your job is mainly concerned with having a
high public opinion so that you can impress your friends.
Maintaining a decent crime rate is not a priority.

End Public Opinion: 90% End Crime Rate: 20% (REG. VERSION ONLY)

Scenario 7, Drug Hideout:  The city you control has become a
haven for the drug lords.  You must destroy at least five drug
HQs.  To accomplish this, build a force of highly trained assault
vans and a large number of detectives and informants.

End Public Opinion: 50% End Crime Rate: 50% (REG. VERSION ONLY)

Map Generator Setup (REGISTERED VERSION ONLY)

The map section of the New Game area sets the random map
generator.  The map generator can be set to three modes: random,
and manual and user-made.  To change the mode from the default 
random mode, click on the Random button.  When the map generator is 
set to manual, you can change the percentages of five areas in the
random map generator. A description of the five areas follows:

Residential:  Residential areas on the map include mainly
houses and town houses.  Unlike other areas, the more
Residential areas there are in a map, the more citizens
there are in the city, and the more taxes you can get.

Commercial:  Commercial areas contain mainly stores,
restaurants, billboards, and gas stations.

Municipal:  This includes pre-built police stations, training
centers, community centers, courthouses, police academies,
prisons,  and rehabilitation centers.  This has no effect in the
scenario number 5, "New Force".

Undeveloped:  Undeveloped areas include abandoned buildings and
empty slots which are suitable for building new police   
buildings.

Other:  Other includes parks, community swimming pools, and  
trailer parks.

There are some rules for setting the random map generator.  These
include:

ù    Commercial area percentages may not exceed 50%.

ù    The sum of municipal and undeveloped areas may not be lower
     than 2%.

ù    The sum of municipal and undeveloped areas may not be higher
     than 10%.

ù    The sum of all areas may be lower than 100%, but it may not
     be higher than 100%.

The user-made option allows you to load a map that you have saved
while playing the game.  There are five slots to choose from.

Difficulty

There are 12 difficulty levels.  They range from level one
which is the easiest and level twelve which is the hardest.  The
difficulty levels not only effect things such as starting money,
starting personnel, starting crime rate and public opinion, but
many other factors.  A description of the differences between the
difficulty levels is in Appendix B: The Difficulty Levels.

Variants (REGISTERED VERSION ONLY)

The six areas in the variants area changes factors at the
beginning the game that would otherwise be set by the
difficulty levels.  So, for example, if you want a challenge
but don't want to have to worry about money, you can set the
difficulty to level 12 and the money variant to +2000.  This
allows the game to be more suited to doing what you enjoy.
No variants need to be set in order to start a game. The six
areas of variants are described below.

Money:  In the money section you can change the amount of money
you start with.  The amounts of +500, +1000, +2000 is the amount
of money you will get in addition to whatever the  difficulty
level gives you.  To see the amount of money a particular
difficulty level gives, see Appendix B: Difficulty Levels.  The
money option "No Money" will set the amount of money that you
start with to 0 regardless of difficulty level.

Personnel:  Here you can change the amount of personnel you
start with.  The +5O, +15P selection adds 5 officers and 15
patrolmen to whatever the difficulty level gives you. The
+10O, +20P and +15O, +30P also do the same, but in respective
amounts.  To see the amount of personnel each particular
difficulty level gives you, see Appendix B: Difficulty Levels.
The personnel option "No Extra" will set the amount of personnel
that you start with to 0 officers, 0 patrolmen regardless of
difficulty level.  The personnel option has no effect when
Scenario 2, "Shortage" is selected.

Civilians:  New in version 1.1, this allows you to change the
maximum number of civilian cars on the map.  Low sets the
number to 15, Medium to 35, and High to 60-70 depending on
the amount of police vehicles that you have.  Be aware that
when it is set to low the game will be faster and that when
it is set to high it will be slower.  The shareware version
defaults to Low.

Public Opinion:  There are 4 choices in the public opinion
area: No change, High, Medium and Low.  High sets the public
opinion to 80%, Medium sets the public opinion to 50%, and Low
sets the public opinion to 20%.  This option has no effect in
Scenario 4, "Riot Recovery".

Crime Rate:  There are 4 choices in the crime rate area: No
change, High, Medium and Low.  High sets the crime rate to
80%, Medium sets the crime rate to 50%, and Low sets the crime
rate to 20%.

Vehicle Stock:  The vehicle stock is the amount of vehicles
that are already in pre-built buildings.  This option changes
the default number of vehicles assigned to a police station.  To
see the number of default vehicles for a particular difficulty 
level, see Appendix B: Difficulty Levels.

Random Events: Near the start button are is the random event
button, or Rd. Ev.  When toggled on, random events happen
sporadically through the game and can do random good things and
random bad things to your police department.

Configuration

The configuration area is where you can change certain options to
fit your liking.  On the bottom of the screen are three
buttons labeled Cancel, Done, and Save.  Cancel exits out of
the configuration menu without changing any options.  Done
exits out of the menu with the currently selected options. Save
saves these options to disk. Above these three buttons are the 
options.  Clicking on them will toggle them on and off.  Below is 
a list of the options and what they do when toggled on.

Weather:  With weather toggled on, occasional rain and snow
storms will occur.  Also, the differences between day and night
will be shown.

Stoplights:  When stoplights are toggled on, vehicles will stop
at red lights and stop signs.

Limited Vision:  Limited vision means that only cars that are
within range of a police vehicle or building can be seen.  With
limited vision off, every vehicle can be seen.

Border Scrolling:  When border scrolling is on, the large map
during the game will scroll when the mouse is at the extreme
edges of the screen.

Sound: When this is on, sound will be too.  Be aware that sound
will play only if the TSTP speech pack is in the same directory.

CHAPTER 2
TUTORIAL

    This chapter will give an example as to how to play the game.
Since events happen randomly, an example of dealing one cannot be
given in this chapter.  For tips on how to deal with events, see
chapter 4.

    The first step is to load the tutorial.  At the main menu,
click on "Load Game".  Then click on saved game number one and
Load.  This will load the tutorial.

    When the game starts several general areas can be seen.  One
is the big map which shows your city enlarged.  This takes up the
majority of the screen.  On top of this is the icon bar and above
the icon bar is the menu bar.  To the right of the big map is a
empty blue rectangle.  This area is where cars will be controlled.
Below the big map is two other blue rectangles.  The left
rectangle is where various miscellaneous items are controlled and
the other rectangle is where information is displayed and can be
reacted to.

    There are many concepts that should you be aware of.  Every
building and car in TSTP requires personnel.  There are two types
of personnel.  Guys with white shirts and ties are officers while
the guys in blue are patrolmen.  You can think of the officers
as super patrolmen.  They can do everything (except for foot
patrols) that a patrolman can.  Patrolmen can do everything an
officer can except for fly a helicopter.  Also, the objective
of the game is usually to get a certain amount of public opinion
and a crime rate.  Your crime rate and opinion are displayed in
a red box with a C and O in it.  The closer the bar is to the
C or O the less that rating is.  If it is half light grey and
half dark grey, then that rating is 50%.  The blue lines are
your goals: have a crime rate to the left of the blue line and 
a opinion to the right of the blue line.

    Notice the small map in the lower right corner.  The dark and
light gray areas are the city street map and buildings.  The brown
squares on the map are empty areas and the green squares are your
police related buildings except for police stations, which are
represented by blue squares.  The white dots are civilian
vehicles.  Finally, the white square shows where your big
map is centered on in your city.

    Notice that this square is centered on a police station.  If
you look in the center of the big map, you will see the police
station.  It is a blue building with "PD" on the roof and a
parking lot next to it.  Click on it.  This will display the
police station in the miscellaneous rectangle in the lower left
hand corner.  This is how you control police-related buildings.

    This display contains a lot of information: notice that it is
police station 1.  To the left is the personnel that the police
station uses (4 patrolmen and 1 officer).  Below this are three
squares that show each police vehicle in the station, its unit ID,
the weapons each car uses, and the personnel assigned to each
vehicle.

    Below it are two upgrade icons.  Click on the left one which has
a computer on it.  This gives the station a crime lab.  Since this
will clear the miscellaneous area, click on the police station again.
The other icon is a helicopter pad.  To the right of these icons are 
the foot patrols.  Click on plus until the number reaches its maximum
(8).  This will increase the visual range of the police station.

    To control the first car in the station (Unit 1/1), click on
its box. This will change the bottom row of icons.  Click on the
second icon from the left. This changes the vehicle's weapon.
Click on the third icon to change it back to a pistol.
Tap the fourth button from the left to assign another officer to
the car.  You can take it off or assign patrolmen to the car with
these buttons.  To deploy the car, click on the first button from
the left.

    You will notice that the police car is deployed.  It is across
the street from the station.  Move the mouse over the car and you
will notice that the mouse cursor changes.  Click now to select
this car.  You can now control this police car. It is also possible
to click on civilian cars to gain information on them.  Notice the
information presented in the blue window to the left of the big map.
On top it tells the year, make, personnel assigned, and unit
designation.  Below this are twelve icons that you can control the
car with.  Below that are its skill, morale, and fatigue ratings.
Finally, on the bottom, is the speed of the car which reads "0".

    To move the car, click on the first button in the second row of
icons.  Click on northwest corner of the small map.  This will
change the big screen.  Click on one of the streets on the big
map.  Then, on the small map, change the big map location to the
previous location over the police station.  You will notice that 
the car has started to pull out into the street and move.  
Increase its speed to 60 by clicking on the rightmost "5" in the
speed area.

    To change the speed of the game, click on the plus button next 
to the "2 sec" on the icon row.  This will increase game speed.  
Increase it to "1 min".  To slow it back down, click on the right 
mouse button.  This button defaults the game speed to 8 seconds.

    Getting back on the police car, click on the stop sign located 
next to the "move to" button (2nd row, 2nd button).  This will 
stop the car.  Then click on the button on the row below the stop
sign.  This will tell the car to return to its assigned police
station.  Be aware that it is not necessary to stop the car in
order to give it an order to return home.  Be sure to read chapter
2 to understand what the other icons do.

    Now let us build a new police building.  To do this, click on
the first button from the left on the icon row on the top of the
screen.  This changes the miscellaneous area to a building 
construction screen.  Notice that the seven types of buildings are 
displayed.  We want to build a courthouse, so click on the second 
building from the left.  Next we must choose a building site.  Click 
on the "Site +" button. This will change the big map to center on 
the construction site. We cannot build the courthouse here because 
the site is only 4 squares big (it is the abandoned building in the
center of the screen).  We need a site with 9 squares.  Click on the
"Site +" button again.  This site is also 4 squares.  Click on the 
"Site +" button once more.  This new site (a fenced in abandoned lot) 
is 9 squares big.  To begin construction, click on the hammer icon.  
Notice that the building will not be immediately built.  It will be 
constructed over a two day period.

    We will now want to buy a new police car.  Click on the buy
new car icon (second from left).  This will again change the
miscellaneous area.  Click on the motorcycle (first button).  Then
we must choose a police station to assign the motorcycle to.  Click
on number one (there are four police stations).  Then click on the
"Buy" button.

    You should man every new vehicle you buy.  To do this, go to
the police station (it is the one that we deployed a car from).
Click on it and you will notice a new motorcycle (Unit 1/4).  Click 
on it's box and click on the patrolmen (blue officer) + button.  This
will assign a person to the bike.  Notice that since it is a
motorcycle, only one person can be assigned.

    Now we will change the overall police posture.  This button is 
located to the right of the buy new car icon.  You can cycle
through the three postures: passive (officer with hand at side),
normal (officer with hand over gun), and aggressive (officer with 
gun drawn).  For now, let's leave the posture on normal.

    The icon next to posture is the car follow lock.  Clicking on
it will keep the screen centered on the currently selected vehicle.
To the right of this you can change assigned building personnel much 
like you can to car personnel.  Click on this icon.  This will change 
the big map to a personnel screen that lists all your police buildings.  
Next to this are control icons, and next to these icons are the assigned
personnel. Notice the redlines next to the personnel. This is the
required number of personnel in order for a building to function.
All your buildings now have the minimum number of people in order
to function.  Click on the "+ patrolman" button on community center 
number 1.  Since this is over the number of required personnel to operate 
the building, it will increase the effect of the community center on the 
community.  Now click on the "norm" button next to the community center.  
This will automatically assign the minimum number of personnel to the 
station.  In this case, it took off the patrolman we just assigned.  Now 
click on "Exit".

    Next to the personnel icon is the budget icon.  Click on it.
Budgets are compounded every four days, but here you can change
its settings before it compounds.  Notice the list of income and
expenses.  Click on the "Tax -" button.  This will decrease the
tax rate.  This will slow the decrease in public opinion that
taxes have on the community.  Click on "Exit".

    The button next to the budget controls the mode the small map
mode.  You can cycle through map modes.  The first is normal, the
second displays area crime rate.  The third displays visual range
of police units and buildings as red diamonds.  Any car that is
not in a diamond cannot be seen.  Cycle the small map back to
normal.

    The button next to this brings up the special assignments 
screen in the miscellaneous area.  Click on the "+ officer" button 
on the Anti-Drug line.  This will increase the number of officers
assigned to Anti-Drug programs which help decrease the crime rate.
Now click on done.

    This concludes the tutorial.  For more tips on gameplay, see 
chapter four.

CHAPTER 3
HOW TO DO THINGS IN THE GAME

The Main Screen

After starting a new game, and after loading it, you will be
taken to the main screen.  Below is a description of the areas
in the main screen.

Top Line

The Top Line is where the two "pull-down" menus are located.  To
access the pulldown menu, click and hold down the left mouse
button on the word File or the word Options.  This accesses their
respective menus.

File Menu

In this menu you can do three things: Save Files, End the Game
and Exit to Dos.  They can be accessed by releasing the mouse
button while the option is highlighted. Save games is easy to
use: click on the slot you wish to save at, and then click on Save.  
End Game will first confirm by asking you if you really want to do
this and then it will take you to the main menu.  Exit to Dos exits
the game; a confirmation of the command will be asked.

Options

This toggles on and off the same options that were also
described in chapter 1.  To change an option, just release the
mouse button when the mouse cursor is on the option you want to
toggle.

Top Icon Line

The top icon line has many icons that have important functions
such as budgeting and personnel.  A description of each icon, from
left to right on the icon bar and what it does follows on the next
few pages.

The first icon, the construction icon, brings up the construction
screen in the miscellaneous area.

The second icon, the vehicle purchase icon, brings up the vehicle
purchase screen in the miscellaneous area.

The third icon controls the overall police posture.  There are
three modes: passive (an officer with his hand at his side),
normal (an officer with his hand on his gun), and aggressive
(an officer with his gun drawn). Public opinion between the three
postures varies: the public opinion improves during a passive
posture, while public opinion erodes during an aggressive opinion.
However, crime rate goes up during a passive posture, while the
crime rate goes down during an aggressive posture.  Also, searches
of citizens during blockades and stops is more effective during 
aggressive postures, but public outrage for stopping someone is
increased.  Finally, during a passive posture only, the police 
will perform random "goodwill" missions like picking up citizens 
and driving them places.  For every random
goodwill mission, public opinion increases.  However, this denies 
use of a vehicle unless you want to dropoff the citizen, in which
the public opinion will then go down.  This button has no effect 
in the Martial Law scenario, when posture is always aggressive.

The next button is the "lock" button.  When it is depressed, the
large screen will automatically scroll so that the current unit is
in the center of the screen.

The next button accesses the main personnel screen.

The next button accesses the main budget screen.

The next button controls the mapmode.  This is the mode of the
small map in the lower right corner.  There are three modes: normal
(a road), crime rate (a gun), and visibility (an eye).  The normal
mode shows the map and visible cars, police vehicles, and police
buildings.  The crime rate mode shows local area crime rates.  In
this mode, green is the lowest, yellow and clear is in between and
red are the highest crime rate areas.  You can use this map to
better decide where to deploy your units.  Certainly it would be
better to heavily patrol a red area than a green area.  The last
mode, visibility, shows the visible area of all your vehicles and
buildings.  This is mode is also important deciding where to deploy
your units.

The next button accesses the special personnel allocation screen.
The special personnel allocation screen is where you can assign
informants, detectives, and public relations personnel.

The next button controls the special option screen.  In the special
option screen you can do special things like take bribes.

The last button is the step button.  When the step button is
depressed, the time speeds by until a new event happens.  ATTENTION!
You cannot control anything while stepping! To stop "stepping", just
click on the step button again.



Scale

The scale is the pace at which the game runs.  Besides
"stepping", there are six other speeds.  These include 1 second,
2 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, 30 seconds, and 1 minute.  The
name of these speeds represents their scale.  To increase the
speed, click on the plus button.  To slow the game speed, click
on the minus speed.  To set the game to 8 seconds, click on the
right mouse button when it is not on the small map.  This serves
as a useful "panic button".

Time

This is the current game time and date.  The date lets you know
how much time until the end of the scenario is reached (the game
will end after 31 days).  The only effect time has in the game is 
the fact that crime is more likely to happen at night.  You can
click on this area and it will change to show you time to go until
the end of the scenario.

Unit Control Screen

In this area, you can control the police vehicles under your
control once they are in the large map.  To select a vehicle,
click on it.  You can also click on civilian vehicles, but only a
vehicle type will show plus the vehicle's speed and its passenger
number.  Each area of the unit control screen will be now
described.


Vehicle Type

At the top is the vehicle's type.  If the vehicle is a civilian
vehicle, this area will display the model make and year.

Current Task

This area shows what the vehicle is currently doing.

Unit Identification

This area displays (you guessed it) the unit's identification.
The first number is the vehicle's assigned police station and
the second number is the vehicles place.  Therefore, a unit with
an identification of "Unit 3/4" would be the fourth vehicle at
police station number three.

Passengers

If the car is a passenger car, it will display the number of
civilians here.  This is important if you have to arrest the 
people in the car, for everyone in the car will have to fit
into the arresting car.  If they cannot fit, they will be
released on the street.  This makes the van's high carrying
capacity much more valuable.

If the car is a police vehicle, the number of officers and
patrolmen are shown.  Left over space in a vehicle is
represented with a number of question marks that corresponds
to the space left over.

Task Icons

In this area you can tell the vehicle to do a task.  A
description of each of the icons as it goes from left to right,
top to bottom follows on the next few pages.

The top three icons are the patrol icons.  They range from a small
area patrol (small circle) to a medium area patrol (medium circle) to
a large area patrol (big circle).  When a vehicle is told to patrol,
it will randomly move within the specified patrol area.  This command
is useful for keeping watch over troublesome areas of the city
and also having ready-to-use forces already on the street should
a problem arise.  During a riot this will make the car go to the 
nearest gathering and disperse it.  To change the specified area that 
unit is patrolling at, click on the large map.

To the right of these three icons is the drop off prisoners button.
This will tell the car to drop off any prisoners at the nearest
courthouse.

On the next row down, the first icon is the general move-to task.
By clicking on this button and then clicking with the left button
on the large map or with the right button on the small map, you can 
move a vehicle to any area on the map.  When the vehicle reaches the 
point that you clicked on, the vehicle will stop.

The next button tells the vehicle to stop what it is doing.  The
vehicle, if it is an automobile, will then pull over to the side
of the street.

The next button tells the unit to train.  When you click on this,
the unit will proceed to the nearest training center.  If there are
no training centers, the unit will stop.  When the unit starts 
training at a training center, its skill will be slowly increased. 
This task applies to automobiles only.

The next button is the investigate task.  By clicking on this
button and then clicking on a building in the large map, the unit 
will go to the building and investigate it.  This command also 
serves as an assault command when detectives or informants discover 
a crime-related building.  The unit will go to the building and 
assault it.  The results of the assault will show in the event 
screen.  This task applies to automobiles only.

The first button on the bottom row is the stop car task.  By clicking 
on the button and then clicking on a civilian vehicle in the large map,
the unit will proceed to stop and search a vehicle.  The results of the
initial search will show in the event screen.  This task applies to
automobiles only.

The next button will return the unit to its assigned precinct.

The next button will bring up the change police station screen in
the miscellaneous area.  With it, you can change the unit's assigned
police station.

The next button will tell the unit stop and set up a blockade.  Any
civilian cars that pass by will be stopped and searched. This task
applies to automobiles only.

The next button is the only button you will see if a unit is
performing a community service during a passive posture.  To stop
it from doing community service and return it to your control, click
on this button.  A public opinion penalty will be incurred for so
rudely stopping the community service.

Below these buttons are three bars.  A description of these bars
follows.

Skill

This shows how effective the unit is at doing things.  The
automobile will do things like search cars, blockade, and fight
better when the skill bar is bigger.

Morale

This is how enthusiastic the unit is about police work.  High
salaries can increase morale, while high fatigue or low salaries
will decrease morale.  When morale gets extremely low, the patrolmen
or officers that are assigned to the unit will quit.

Fatigue

This statistic is how tired the unit is.  The more the unit is out 
on the large map, the more fatigued it will get.  When fatigue is 
high, morale starts to decrease.  When a unit is back at its police 
station, the fatigue will get lower.

Below this is the speed.

Speed

This is the current speed in miles per hour that the unit is 
traveling at.  If the unit is civilian and the speed is over 35 
miles per hour, it is speeding.  If the unit is a police unit, you 
can change its speed in increments of one by clicking on the plus 
and minus buttons.  To change its speed in increments of five, click 
on the plus five and minus five buttons.  By clicking on the number
itself you can set the vehicle automatically to maximum speed. 
Beware that civilians don't like to see an officer speeding all the
time.  All units have a maximum speed.  To see each vehicle's max
speed, see Appendix A: Vehicles.

Large Map

The large map is where all the action takes place in the game. Here 
is where you can see your do their various tasks.  You can also see 
various facets of the city you police.  You can also click on 
police-related buildings so that you can control them. Notice that 
this area is only a portion of the overall city.

Small Map

The small map is a view of the whole city.  You can change where
your large map is positioned at by clicking on the small map.
Various elements of the city can be seen in different colors.  A
description of each color is described below:

Light Gray Blocks:  These are the normal streets that all
automobiles drive on.

Dark Gray Blocks:  These dark gray blocks represent civilian
buildings.

Light Blue Blocks:  These blocks are police stations.

Dark Green Blocks:  These blocks are other police-related
buildings.

Light Brown Blocks: These blocks represent undeveloped areas.

Dark Green Dots:  These dots are riot areas.

Yellow Dots:  These dots represent police-controlled Vehicles.

White Dots:  These dots represent civilian vehicles.

Yellow "X":  This X is where the current event happened at.

Red Dots:  Red Dots represent criminal locations as discovered by
detectives and informants.

Event Screen

This game is for displaying events as they happen in the game.
These events can range from new 911 calls to the results of
investigations to the discovery of new criminal locations.  Since
events can sometimes happen one after another, the event screen
"queues" them, or keeps them available for a time (usually a
a couple of game days).  When a new event happens, the event 
screen automatically switches to it, but you can always change 
which event you are looking at by clicking on the two arrow keys 
at the lower right hand of the event screen.  A display of the 
number of events is also available in the lower right hand of 
the event screen.  In the top of the event screen, a description 
of the event is displayed and any details associated with it.  In 
the lower left hand is a one word description of the type of 
event.  Some events will also have icons in the lower left hand 
area.  Here you can conveniently take action to any event that 
might happen in the event screen from the event screen.  Some 
icons that have already been described may be showed.  A 
description of some icons that are unique to the event screen 
follow on the next page.

One icon, a white square with three arrows point the same
direction, will automatically scroll the large map to the event
area so that you can take personal care of the situation.

Another icon that is available when the event is a crime like
murder or a discovery of a criminal location will automatically
send the nearest police unit to the event scene.  If no police
units are displayed, this icon will do nothing.  If the event is a
911 call, you can also send a car near the event scene and have the
same effect.  This button is very useful and should be used often.

The icon that shows a officer looking in the back of a trunk is the 
search button.  When a police car is given the order to search a
car, the car will do an initial search, and based on skill, report
his findings.  This button gives the police unit involved
permission to completely search the civilian unit involved.  Note
that if the civilian unit is innocent, public opinion will be
decreased.

Miscellaneous Area

This area is used for tasks that don't fit into other areas.
These tasks can include deploying units from police stations,
building new police-related buildings, and buying new vehicles.
A description of some of the things you can do in the
miscellaneous area follows.

Building new buildings

A description of the buildings you can build, from left to right,
follow.

Police Station:  The police station is the mainstay of any
police force.  It can hold up to four vehicles.  When units are
at their police station, their fatigue is reduced.  Always make
sure to have many strategically placed police stations.

Courthouse:  The courthouse is where all the judging of
criminals takes place.  If you get warnings that your
courthouses can not handle the criminal load, be sure to build
more courthouses.  If the courthouses cannot handle the amount
of criminals, some criminals will be set free causing a big
increase in the crime rate.

Prison:  The prison is where the criminals are stored for the
duration of their sentence.  Like the courthouse, always make
sure their are enough prisons or else criminals will be set
free.

Rehab Center:  A rehab center, or rehabilitation center, is an
alternative to the prison.  If rehab centers are unfilled, a
criminal will automatically be sentenced to one instead of a
prison.  There they will serve a three day sentence regardless
of whatever judgement you may have given them.  When they are
done with their sentence, they will be released and become
positive influences on society.

Training Center:  A training center is where you can increase
your individual units' skill.  They will become better
investigators, fighters, and interrogators.

Community Center:  Community centers try to increase public
opinion by sponsoring various programs like the Police Athletic
League and Neighborhood Watch programs.

Police Academy:  A police academy is where new officers and
patrolmen can be trained.  New patrolmen or officers will be
enter the force every two days.

To build a new police building, first click on the building
desired.  Then select a construction site.  Use the two 
buttons to go through the availible sites.  Notice that there are
two types of construction sites: large open empty slots, and
abandoned buildings.  Police stations, community centers, and
training centers can be built on either type, but courthouses,
prisons, rehab centers, and police academies can be built only on
empty slots.  To build the building, click on the Build this icon
only when the building type fits the right slot.  Below is a
description of each building and its function.  Small buildings,
like police stations and community centers, will take one game
day to build at a cost of 150 "dollars" per day.  Large buildings
will take two game days to build at a cost of 150 "dollars" per
day.

Buying new vehicles

The top of this screen is the area and picture of the vehicles you 
can buy.  Below the picture is the cost of each vehicle.  Below the 
selection of vehicles is your current amount of money.  Note that 
you can't buy a vehicle without having the necessary funds.  Below 
your amount of money are the police station numbers.  A police 
station number will be black if it has no helicopter pad, and white 
if it does.  If you want to buy a helicopter, you must place it at a
police station with a helicopter pad. It will be shaded over if
the police station is currently filled and cannot except more
vehicles.  If all the police station numbers are shaded over
(like above), you cannot buy new vehicles until a new police
station is built, or until you lose a vehicle.  You must click on
an unshaded police station number to assign your new unit before
you can click on the Buy This icon.  Also, after buying your car,
be aware that you must give it at least one patrolmen before you
can use it. Below is a description of each vehicle.

The first vehicle is the police motorcycle.  Although it is a
inexpensive unit, it is limited in that it can only carry one
personnel member, which makes it less effective at fighting.  It
can, however, perform effective investigations and other police
duties.

The second vehicle is the police cruiser.  This is the standard
police vehicle.  When loaded with four personnel, it makes for an
effective fighter.  Its relatively slow speed makes it a bit too
slow for chases.

Which brings us to the third car, the Fastcar.  Although it can
only carry two people, its high speed of 95 miles per hour makes
it specially suited to chases.  (REGISTERED VERSION ONLY)

The fourth car is the unmarked car.  It performs almost
identically to the cruiser, but it is has a much bigger visual
range.  This is because people do not know the car is in the
area, and won't hide themselves from police.  Be advised, however,
because the public does not like the feeling of "secret police"
that an unmarked patrol force carries with it. (REG. VERSION ONLY)

The fifth vehicle is the van.  Though slow and expensive, when
equipped with eight officers and M-16's it makes a deadly assault
force.  Always try to keep one or two trained assault vans on
hand for attacking any criminal locations.  (REG. VERSION ONLY)

The final vehicle is the helicopter.  Although it can't
investigate, assault, or train, it has the best visibility of all
other units and, with its speed, is good for tracking possible
suspects and keeping watch over the crime ridden areas of the
city.  (REG. VERSION ONLY)

The Police Station

Here you can deploy units assigned to a police station.  This screen
is brought up by clicking on a particular police station in the main
screen.  You can also recall units that have been deployed or change
the large map location to the deployed units position.

First, you'll notice the top line in the police station area.
This tells the police station's number and its assigned
personnel.  If there is less than minimum amount of personnel
assigned, this area will be shaded over and you will not be able
to use the police station.

The next area in the police station screen is the four boxes. 
These represent the assigned vehicles to the station.  If only
two vehicles are assigned, you will only see two boxes.  In each
of these boxes are two smaller boxes.  One shows if a vehicle is
in the police station or not, and the other shows the current
weapon the vehicle is using.  Below these boxes are is the units
identification and the personnel assigned to the individual unit.

The area below the boxes is the police station icon row.  You
will see different icons here based on the boxes above.  If you
have not clicked on a box, you will see the police station icons.
These include the two upgrade icons.  When there is a box around
the icons, the upgrade is not yet at the police station.  The two
upgrade icons are as follows:

The first button is the crime lab upgrade.  When a police station
has this upgrade, units assigned to the police station will conduct
better searches and investigations.

The second button is the helicopter pad upgrade. When a police
station has this, it can support helicopters.

Next to the upgrade icons is the amount of foot patrols a police
station has.  Foot patrolling increases a police station's
visible range, at the expense of patrolmen.  A police station can
have from zero to eight patrolmen assigned to foot patrols.
By clicking on plus and minus, patrolmen will be assigned from
the general patrolmen pool.

The police station icon row will be different when a box is
clicked on.  If the unit is out of the station, you will get two
icons: the large map scroll button which will scroll the large
map to the unit's position, and the return to station button.  If
the unit is in the station, the first icon is the deploy button
which will deploy a unit out of the police station.  The other
icons will change the assigned weapon and the number of officers
and patrolmen assigned to each unit.  A description of each
weapon follows on the next page:

The first weapon is the standard police baton. While there is not 
much public outrage for using it, it is ineffective at almost
everything except for riots, where it is mediocre.

The second weapon is the standard .45 caliber pistol.  It is
effective at street encounters, but it is not at building assaults.
There is some public recourse for using a pistol.  Pistols are not
effective during riots and there will be tremendous public outcry
if a unit tries to silence a riot with a pistol.

The third weapon is riot gear.  Riot gear is effective only at 
stopping riots.

The fourth weapon, the M-16 rifle, is extremely effective at 
building assaults, but usage in any other area is opinion damaging 
to say the least.  When M-16's are used during riots, expect a quick 
end to your career as police chief.




Special Personnel Allocation Screen

There are four special allocation areas where officers and
patrolmen can be assigned.  Obviously, areas will be more
effective when more personnel are assigned, and an area will be
more effective when it has ten officers assigned as opposed to
ten patrolmen.  The four areas are as follows:

Anti-Crime:  Anti-Crime personnel will generally try to reduce
the crime rate through various means like going to schools 
and talking to schoolchildren about crime.

Detective:  Detectives are needed to discover hidden criminal
locations like crack houses and drug headquarters.  Beware,
however, detectives will sometime falsely discover a location
resulting in a lower public opinion for trying to assault an
innocent location.  Discoveries will show up in the event screen
and as a red dot in the small map.

Informants:  Informants function exactly like detectives, but
they are more effective.  Beware, however, because unlike
detectives, informants stand a chance of getting killed in the
line of duty.

PR: Public Relations (or PR) personnel try to increase public
opinion.

Special Options Screen

There are two special options.  By clicking on them, you can
toggle them on and off.  The first option, taking bribes, has the
benefit of adding 100 "dollars" to the budget every four days in
return for an increased crime rate and the chance at getting
caught.  If you get caught, public opinion will decrease
drastically.  The second option, appeal for calm, costing 50
"dollars" per week, lowers the chance of rioting when public
opinion is low.  Be advised, however, this has no effect on
public opinion itself.
Other Building's Screens

You can bring up a police station screen by clicking on a police 
station in the large map.  By clicking on other police-related 
buildings, you can likewise bring up information about other 
buildings. On one building, the police academy, you can change how many
officers and patrolmen are trained every few days.

Other Screens

Budgeting

The budgeting screen, brought up by clicking on the budget icon
in the top icon line, is where finances can be controlled.  The
budget is compounded every 4 days, and it will be brought up
automatically after each adjustment.  However, you may want to
change some figures before the end of the budget period.  The
main method of finance is the security tax.  Since taxing has an
obvious effect on public opinion, it is beneficial to try and
keep taxes low.  By clicking on the salary buttons, you can
adjust your officer and patrolmen salaries.  Remember, 40 per
year is considered the median for officers and 25 per year is
considered the median for patrolmen.  Anything less than the
median will cause morale to drop and anything more will cause
morale to increase.

Personnel

Here is where you can assign your officers and personnel to your
police buildings.  Notice the top line.  The officers and
patrolmen numbers are the numbers of leftover policemen.  These
can be directly assigned to vehicles and to foot patrols in the
police station screen.  The numbers next to them is the total
number of officers and patrolmen.  You are responsible for paying
each one of them a salary, so it is beneficial to try and keep an
efficient number of policemen.  To get rid of policemen, click on
the Fire Patrolmen or the Fire Officer button.  Remember,
however, they cannot be rehired if you want them back.  The only
way to get new officers and patrolmen is through police
academies.  Notice below these numbers is each individual
building and its policemen "draw".  Notice the red line in the
area where it shows the assigned policemen.  This red line, in
both the officer and patrolmen areas, is the minimum number of
officers and patrolmen a building must have to operate.  Certain
buildings, like courthouses, training centers, and community
centers, will have increased effectiveness when there is a
surplus of personnel assigned.
CHAPTER 4
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

Overall Objective

If you have read Chapter 3, you have probably discovered by now
that there are two main elements in this game that will require
your attention in order to win.  These elements are public
opinion and crime rate.  The difference between winning and
losing a scenario depends solely on the public opinion and crime
rate at the end of the scenario's term.  Therefore, this chapter
will focus on how to better public opinion by raising it and how
to better the crime rate by lowering it.

At the start of a game

After selecting all the options at the beginning of a game, and
when you reach the game play area, there are some immediate
things you will want to change.

First, you will probably want to go to your budget screen and
check your finances.  Make sure you know how much you can spend
safely.  Be careful not to go into debt, for if you do, the first
casualties will be officers and patrolmen because they will not
be paid.  As a result, their morale will go down, and if this
debt is sustained, you will have mass quitting of the police
personnel.  Make sure to lower your taxes to as low as possible
as high taxes decrease public opinion rapidly.

Second, you will want to analyze where your buildings, and
especially your police stations, are spread. If this is the "New
Force" scenario, or if you selected a low level of pre-built
municipal buildings, or if there is a large area devoid of a
police station, you will want to consider building new police-
related buildings.  Try to give police stations the choice
construction sites, because except for perhaps training areas,
only their position on the map matters.

Third, if the vehicle stock (the number of vehicles assigned to
each police station before the game) is low, start buying
vehicles according to budget.  Evaluate your needs and buy
accordingly: motorcycles are good cheap units, cruisers are good
all around units and in the registered version,  helicopters are 
the best at patrolling areas and keeping track of possible 
criminals, vans are good at assaulting buildings, and try to throw 
in a fastcar or two to respond quickly to crimes and chases.

If this is the "Shortage" scenario, make sure to go to the
personnel screen and assign personnel to only the essential
buildings.  In any other scenario assign excess personnel to
courthouses, training centers, police academies, and community
centers.  Courthouses will be able to handle more cases.
Training centers will train faster.  Police academies can train
more recruits.  Community centers will effect public opinion
better.

You will probably now want to evaluate your special personnel
options.  If this is a hard difficulty level, it will probably be
your best bet to assign more personnel to detective than to
informant because informants are easily killed in the hard
difficulty levels.  As for Anti-Crime and PR, you will probably
want to assign the maximum number of people that you can to
these areas.  In the other special options screen, you may want
to consider taking bribes if your money is low and lots of
upgrades to your police force are needed or if you have a high
public opinion and can afford the loss of support should you be
discovered.

Finally, start patrols.  First deploy helicopters to strategic
areas and use the visual mapmode to try to blanket the map with
police visual coverage.  This increases the possibility of
randomly spotting crimes in progress and increases speed when
reacting to 911 calls.

Should a crime happen...

There are three types of crimes in To Serve and To Protect: 911
calls which include heavy crimes like murder and rape, visual
calls which include light crimes like speeding and vandalism plus
the heavy crimes, and rare crimes which cannot you cannot control
the arresting of but you must judge on.  When a 911 call happens,
manually take control and send all the nearest units, especially
helicopters.  Try to track all the civilian vehicles in the
immediate area of the crime.  Meanwhile, send a car with a high
skill to interrogate the victim.  If the car has a high skill or
is lucky, then it will tell you the exact car that perpetrated the
crime.  If you find only that the victim escaped by car, stop the
most likely cars which you think may have committed the crime.  If
you find out nothing from the interrogation, try again with the
same unit or one with more skill.  When it comes to stopping suspect
cars, try to stop the car with a unit with a high skill so that a
search will be successful.  Make sure that the stopping vehicle
has enough room to hold any criminals that the civilian vehicle
may have.  Also, try not to send a motorcycle or another vehicle
with few personnel, because should the criminal try to fight it out,
the single motorcycle cop will be dead.  Try to have a fastcar in
the area, because if the criminal tries to escape by speed, you will
easily be able to stop him.  Finally, make sure the vehicle that is
being pursued is kept in sight or else pursuing vehicles will lose
their track of the vehicle and stop.

Assaulting Criminal Locations

At the beginning of the game, depending on your difficulty level,
there are a number of "criminal locations" that are hidden to
you.  These include crack houses, drug labs, and drug HQs.  The
only way to uncover these locations is by assigning detectives
and informants.  When the detectives and informants discover a
criminal location, plans for an assault should be made.  Beware,
however, because detectives and informants sometimes give false
reports.  To an assault a building, always use units that are
armed with machine guns.  Also, fill the assault vehicles to
their personnel capacity.  Finally, try to use vehicles with a
high skill level.  A van with eight officers armed with machine
guns makes an excellent assault vehicle.  To tell a unit to
assault, click on the investigate icon (see page 18) and then
click on the building or use the send nearest button on the 
message that informs you of the location.

Judging

NOTE: Prison terms will be in days (ie: 5years=5days) for reasons
of gameplay.
How you judge a criminal depends on your ratio of rehab centers
to jails.  If there are a lot of jails, try to go for a long
prison sentence.  If you give the criminal a short sentence that
will end before your term as police chief is up, the criminal
will be released and almost certainly become a negative effect on
society (i.e. crime rate will increase).  If you have a lot of
rehab centers and they are empty, crime sentences will
automatically be set to three days regardless of the sentence
you give and the criminal will end up having a positive effect on
society.  If you have hardly any prison space or do not want to
build new jails, give the criminals the smallest sentence
possible. No matter what you do, however, if the public is not
indifferent to a crime and wants either a heavy or light
sentence, do what the public wants.  It is not worth the public
opinion loss and if you go extremely against the public, public
opinion could be lowered enough that riots break out.  Just look
at what the whole Rodney King affair did to Los Angeles in 1992.

Riots

Should riots unfortunately break out, immediately send all your
units home and outfit them with riot gear.  Send them back out
and give them the patrol command.  During riots, the patrol
command will automatically go to the nearest riot area and spend
time dispersing it.

Posture

If your public opinion is low, you should almost always have your
posture in passive.  Try not to interrupt police units when they
are performing community service missions, as this tends to lower
public opinion ("Those darned police offered my son a ride home,
but dropped him off in the middle of town!").  If you have the
public opinion to spare, set the posture to a normal or
aggressive posture.  The police always work better when they are
unconstrained.
