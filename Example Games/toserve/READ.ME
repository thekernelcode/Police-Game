This is the official speech pack for To Serve and To Protect.  Just
copy all the SOUND*.DAT files into the TSTP root directory.  If TSTP
is set to "No Sound", delete SOUND.CFG and select a sound output device.
The speech pack will add the following sounds:

 - Intro Sounds

 - Unit Responses

 - Other sound effects like thunder and gunshots

If you wish to later get rid of just the speech pack, you can delete
sound*.dat files to free up about a half a megabyte of space.
